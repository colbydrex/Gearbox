
Creating a repository for Code Louisville project.

	IDEA

building a website for a bar/ restaurant owned by my moms and step dad

Murfs Gearbox 
	- Murf = my parents bigass English Mastiff, who is the coolest dog ever [dont tell my dog I said that] and their baby
	- Gearbox = because they like motorcycles (i think), they do a lot of work with the American Legion, organizing bike rides and fund raisers all the time

Its actually a pretty cool place, with almost a Roosters vibe (minus some of the sports) pool tables, cornhole, occasional concert or car/bike show.
	- so if you are ever on Hwy 27 crossing the KY state line into TN, stop in and have a meal and a drink
	- be advised - thick accents

- I will upload a rough sketch of the site next, it is still in development, and will probably change a few hundred times before, or if it ever is "completed"
- At first (now), this website is primarily for my project.
- longer term,  live, fully functional, updated regularly with specials and hosted events.
